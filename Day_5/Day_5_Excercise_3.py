# Day 5 - Exercise 3 - Adding Even Numbers

# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. 
# Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

# i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

# Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. 
# It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.

# Hint
# There are quite a few ways of solving this problem, but you will need to use the range() function in any of 
# the solutions.
# Test Your Code
# Check your code is doing what it is supposed to. When you're happy with your code, 
# click submit to check your solution.

# Write your code below this row üëá

# Resolvendo o problema de somar os n√∫meros pares de 1 at√© 100:
number_sum = 0
for number in range(1, 101):
    if number%2==0:
        number_sum += number
print(number_sum)

# Resolvendo o problema de somar os n√∫meros pares de 1 at√© 100 pela abordagem da professora:
# A professora usa o argumento step da fun√ß√£o range() para selecionar somente os n√∫meros pares.
# 2, 4, 6, 8 ...
# 2, 6, 12, 20 ...
print(number_sum)

total = 0
for number in range(2, 101, 2):
    total += number
print(total)
